The pypdf library is used to read and extract text from PDF files. This allows the chatbot to process and analyze text content from PDF documents.
Hereâ€™s a summary of the key tech stacks:

spaCy for NLP tasks.
Hugging Face Transformers for the question-answering model.
PyPDF for extracting text from PDF files.
These libraries together enable the chatbot to read and process text from PDFs, perform NLP tasks, and answer questions based on the extracted text.
